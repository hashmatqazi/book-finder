have a task to build a “Book Finder” app using the Open Library API. The user persona is Alex, a college student who wants to search books easily...using react what installation is needed
Perfect 👍 — since you’re building a Book Finder app using React and the Open Library API, let’s make sure your setup is ready.

🧰 Step-by-Step Installation Guide
1️⃣ Install Node.js

You must have Node.js installed (version 18+ or 22+ preferred).
✅ Check:

node -v
npm -v


If not installed, download from 👉 https://nodejs.org

2️⃣ Create Your React App (with Vite for speed)

Use Vite (modern React setup) instead of create-react-app.

For JavaScript:
npm create vite@latest book-finder -- --template react
For TypeScript (recommended):

npm create vite@latest book-finder -- --template react-ts
Then:

cd book-finder
npm install
Start the App
npm run dev


👉 It will show a local URL (like http://localhost:5173) — open it in your browser.
Install Useful Libraries

You’ll need some extra libraries to make the app look and work nicely.

💡 Optional but recommended:
npm install axios react-icons
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled   # (if using Material UI)

5️⃣ API You’ll Use
You’ll be calling the Open Library Search API:

https://openlibrary.org/search.json?q=harry+potter


Example fetch (in React):

import axios from "axios";
import { useState } from "react";

function BookFinder() {
  const [query, setQuery] = useState("");
  const [books, setBooks] = useState([]);

  const searchBooks = async () => {
    const res = await axios.get(`https://openlibrary.org/search.json?q=${query}`);
    setBooks(res.data.docs);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>📚 Book Finder</h1>
      <input value={query} onChange={e => setQuery(e.target.value)} placeholder="Search books..." />
      <button onClick={searchBooks}>Search</button>
      <ul>
        {books.map((book, i) => (
          <li key={i}>{book.title} by {book.author_name?.[0]}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}

export default BookFinder;

I already installed thus apart from that
Excellent 👍 — if you already installed React + Vite and can run the app (npm run dev works), then you’ve done the main setup.

Now, let’s see what else you might need specifically for the Book Finder project — beyond the base installation.
Additional Things You May Need
1️⃣ API Fetching Library

If not already installed:

npm install axios


➡️ Makes it easier to call the Open Library API.
Styling Options (choose one)

You’ll want your Book Finder to look neat.

Option A — Tailwind CSS (simple + modern)
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p


Then edit tailwind.config.js:
content: ["./index.html", "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"],
and add in src/index.css:

css
Copy code
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
Run npm run dev again — now you can use Tailwind classes like:
Option B — Material UI
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled


Then you can use ready components like <TextField> and <Button>.

I want setup
You said:
Yes
You said:
I make folder as project
You said:
My local address 3000 showing 
You said:
How to share this link in github
You said:
No path directy
You said:
Error 
You said:
But I got output in browser 
I want simple 
Install axios

To fetch data easily:

npm install axios


That’s it.
No need for Tailwind, router, or MUI if you want simple.
Folder Setup

Your Vite app already has:

book-finder/
 ┣ src/
 ┃ ┣ App.jsx
 ┃ ┣ main.jsx
 ┃ ┗ index.css
 ┣ index.html
 ┣ package.json

Run Your App
npm run dev

I installed node 22 version
I want setup
npm create vite@latest book-finder -- --template react
cd book-finder
npm install
npm install axios
npm run dev
You’ll see something like:

Local:   http://localhost:5173/
My local address 3000 showing
If your app is running at
👉 http://localhost:3000/

then it means you probably created your React app using Create React App (CRA) instead of Vite — and that’s 100% okay.
Since you’re using Create React App, just follow these simple steps 👇

1️⃣ Install axios
npm install axios
Save all files and go back to your terminal

If your app is still running, it will automatically reload.
If not, run:

npm start


Then visit 👉 http://localhost:3000
